Welcome to my research blog for the George Garth Graham Undergraduate Digital History Research Fellowship, 2015. I will be posting every week some of my thoughts on Minecraft, digital history in general, and the educational and historical benefits of using Minecraft and videogames as a form of teaching and a form of scholarship. \r\n\r\nI am currently a third year history student at Carleton University, and you can find me on Twitter here: [@rapickering](http://www.twitter.com/rapickering/). \r\n______\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
