Welcome to my research blog for the George Garth Graham Undergraduate Digital History Research Fellowship, 2015. I will be posting every week some of my thoughts on Minecraft, digital history in general, and the educational and historical benefits of using Minecraft and videogames as a form of teaching and a form of scholarship. \r\n\r\nI am currently a third year history student at Carleton University, and you can find me on Twitter here: [@rapickering](http://www.twitter.com/rapickering/). \r\n______\r\n##First Blog Post / Minecraft in High Schools\r\n#### January 17, 2015\r\n___\r\nWelcome to the first blog post of my research fellowship with Dr. Graham! This week, a simple task. Dr. Graham asked me to take a look online at what other educators in high schools were doing with Minecraft in terms of history. I needed to figure out what history teachers were doing, what they were trying to do, and what they needed. What I found was surprisingly in-depth and good history for the most part! There were some very interesting usages of the tools in Minecraft, in MinecraftEDU especially, and in looking at the actual gameplay of Minecraft, there were some unorthodox approaches which surprised me and were surprisingly effective. \r\n\r\nIn a game with limited text capabilities such as Minecraft, it would be difficult to create a historically based videogame without some sort of outside reference. The majority of projects I found had this, either in the form of outside class discussion of what happened in Minecraft, or supplementary assignments to discuss what was done primarily in Minecraft (and vice versa - Minecraft does not have to be the primary focus, it can be supplementary instead).\r\n\r\nComing at this, I drew from what I had learned from HIST3812A in the fall semester about Minecraft. Namely, good historical gaming in Minecraft is not superficial: it does not simply act as a facade of historical learning over an already complete game. To make good historical gaming, one must come at creating the game with the mechanics and metaphors inherent in the platform of Minecraft in mind: the game must be built in a way that puts the history directly into the gameplay mechanics. Not to contradict what I wrote earlier, but the projects I found online were varied in their success with this. \r\n\r\nOne of my favourite pieces I found, by John Miller from Chalone Peaks Middle School, was about [Japanese poetry](http://minecraft.edtecworks.com/2015/01/09/medieval-japanese-poetry-and-minecraft/). His unit on medieval Japanese history utilized multiple aspects of Minecraft to explore the history and social structure of feudal Japan through the imagery of Japanese poetry. Students would research one of four hierarchical classes and the history of a certain time period of Japan outside of Minecraft. Then the students learnt about the traditional tanka poem as an expression of emotion and imagery in Japan. Miller wrote that he felt Minecraft's visuals were very Japanese in nature, and thus had his students write tanka poems that represented said emotion and imagery from the viewpoint of one of the four research hierarchies in feudal Japan. The students then picked one of several designated areas to place their poems, created pathways through the landscape, and used MinecraftEDU blocks to read the poem to the player and give them symbolic items. It is a very visually stunning project that incorporates writing, research, and beautiful imagery that seems very effective. In some ways, however, this project does not use the capabilities of Minecraft to it's full effect. Why not place the players in actual feudal Japan? Using GIS imagery and terraforming to create rice fields and country roads, as well as building ancient Edo, would make the connection between Japanese society, poetic language, and environments all the stronger. Most of the work is done outside of Minecraft, as well: while this may be unavoidable, especially for teachers who do not want their classes just to turn into video-game time, I cannot help but feel there is more immersion possible with this topic. \r\n\r\nAnother history project I found was led by a teacher at San Antonio Academy about the [American Civil War](http://saaminecraft.edublogs.org/2013/01/28/battlefields-special-projects-complete/). Students were to research Civil War battles and create simulations of them in Minecraft, then present them through video (links to those videos can be found on the aforementioned page). This particular project, while still utilizing outside research as the basis for the Minecraft experience, used Minecraft in a very different way than John Miller's did above. Facts about the Battle of Atlanta and the Battle of Gettysburg are presented in a guided museum tour through books and signs. Though I first thought this was a poor way to represent this history, the guided museum tour of the information used Minecraft's exploratory mechanics of gameplay in a good way. The battlefields are represented on the landscape outside of these museums and seen from a bird's eye view when climbing onto the creator's \"sky bridges\": troop movements and battle strategies of both the Confederacy and the Union are laid out in red and blue respectively. This representation of battles allows for a better understanding of how the battles actually happened, but again, this is somewhat of a superficial rendering of history in Minecraft. For example, yes, one can represent battle history in Minecraft fairly easy. But what about the political, social and economic factors that led to the Civil War and these battles in the first place? Is there not a way to utilize Minecraft in more subtle ways that subvert traditional military histories like this? Granted, these are student created projects, constrained by (assumedly) limited time and resources, and no doubt an educational bias for these kinds of traditionalist history. But I personally would much rather see a more creative use of Minecraft than simply to document battle facts in new ways. Instead, teachers should strive to have Minecraft worlds that don't represent one small aspect of a history, but utilize all the tools available in Minecraft to create more inclusive, subversive history programs that document other factors and include excluded voices.\r\n\r\nWith all of this said, I will say that right now, I do not have any concrete solutions to the problems of Minecraft in high schools. And perhaps the problems that exist are unimportant if Minecraft is already helping students succeed. But it does feel like it is as accessible and well-used as it could be (for example, the majority of the projects I found online were at private schools). But examining what is out there being done in elementary and high school Minecraft education, especially concerning history, can help us understand how to better it. \r\n\r\nThese are just two projects out of many that I saw, not all concerning history, that used Minecraft to teach history in a less traditional way than textbooks or essays, though both are implicitly still there in the background of these blog posts. You can find many of those projects on this [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/113884091278414495934), where educators share. People who are working with Minecraft are doing good things generally. They are engaging with the game, they are learning how it works, and they are letting it be another tool in their teaching arsenal to get concepts across to students who might not necessarily want to read everything out of a textbook. History teachers realize already that Minecraft is a wonderful platform for simulation, and many are doing that. What they need from educational technology is the tools and resources to more effectively do that simulating, without so much impact from outside resources. While it may be unreasonable to expect a Minecraft history game to be fully self-contained, more emphasis can be placed on the history actually being discovered within Minecraft, instead of simply being represented superficially. \r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks, though, I will be spending a lot of time listening to a YouTube series I found that deals with this exact material: [Minechat](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD3F726E583E57A00). Educators discuss their own uses of Minecraft in the classroom in a number of disciplines, such as science and math, but also humanities, social studies, and history. As I found this series shortly before I wanted to submit this blog post, I did not get to delve into it as much as I would have liked. Next week, though, I will share some of the things I learn from this series and discuss them here. \r\n\r\nI hope you've enjoyed this first post - truth be told, I am fairly nervous to put this first piece out on the web that Dr. Graham will undoubtedly share with his edtech and DH peers. If you thought this was a good piece, an okay piece, if I violated some rule of academic blogging I was not aware of, or if you have any sort of feedback (constructive or otherwise), feel free to send me a tweet at [@rapickering](http://www.twitter.com/rapickering)! Thank you for reading, and check back next week for another post about Minecraft and education!\r\n\r\n> Ryan Pickering","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
